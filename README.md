## Project Description

Flutter Home Widget Quotes is a Flutter application that allows users to view, manage, and interact with inspirational quotes. The app integrates with home screen widgets, enabling users to quickly access and update quotes directly from their device's home screen.

## Features

- View a list of inspirational quotes.
- Add, edit, and delete quotes.
- Tag quotes for easy organization.
- Home screen widget integration (Android/iOS).
- Persistent storage using Hive database.
- Interactive widget actions (increment, clear, etc.).
- Responsive and modern UI.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter_home_widget_quotes.git
   cd flutter_home_widget_quotes
   ```

2. **Install Flutter**
   - Ensure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - For iOS (requires Xcode):
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

5. **(Optional) Setup Hive Database**
   - No manual setup required; the app initializes Hive on startup.

6. **(Optional) Widget Setup**
   - For widget functionality, ensure you grant necessary permissions and follow platform-specific setup as described in the [home_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/home_widget) package documentation.

## Roadmap

## Project Overview for New Contributors

This section provides a high-level overview of the codebase to help new contributors get started quickly.

### Architecture

The project is a Flutter application with the following main components:

- **Frontend (Flutter UI):** Handles all user interactions, displays quotes, and manages navigation.
- **Widget Integration:** Uses the `home_widget` package to communicate between the app and home screen widgets.
- **Local Database:** Uses Hive for persistent storage of quotes and tags.
- **State Management:** Uses the `provider` package for managing app state (quotes, tags).

### Major Folders and Files

- `lib/`
  - `main.dart`: App entry point, widget setup, and main logic.
  - `models/`: Data models for quotes and tags.
  - `provider/`: State management for quotes and tags.
  - `quote_home_page.dart`: Main UI for viewing and managing quotes.
  - `dash_with_sign.dart`: Custom widget for displaying the counter.
  - `helper/`: Utility functions and platform-specific bridges.
- `screenshots/`: Contains screenshots for documentation and PRs.
- `pubspec.yaml`: Project dependencies and metadata.

### How Components Interact

- The app starts from `main.dart`, initializing Hive and setting up providers.
- UI components interact with providers to read/write data.
- Widget actions (increment, clear) are handled via callbacks and update both the UI and the widget.
- The database (Hive) persists all quotes and tags locally.
